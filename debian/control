Description: intuitive, fast, scalable C++ machine learning library (development libs)
 This package contains the mlpack Library development files.
 .
 Machine Learning Pack (mlpack) is an intuitive, fast, scalable C++
 machine learning library, meant to be a machine learning analog to
 LAPACK.  It aims to implement a wide array of machine learning
 methods and function as a "swiss army knife" for machine learning
 researchers.
